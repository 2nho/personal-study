sql server from subquery why need alias 


every subquery in the FROM need to have alias name inSQL

You have to define so you can add further constraints to your query. otherwise, your DB Engine willn't know how to refer to the subquery.

We can think of the subquery result as a new table, but this table has no name, so give him an alias.
